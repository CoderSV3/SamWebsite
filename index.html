The important thing to know about him is that he's come a long way despite many hardships and setbacks he had as a boy. He's actually into reading manga, watching anime, training in Krav Maga and Muay Thai, playing chess, playing video games, drawing, and obviously coding! He also works part-time jobs at businesses/companies to his liking. See <a href="./about.html" alt="About Page"> About</a> for a detailed synopsis. <br> <br> Photo of Sam </p>
